## üõ°Ô∏è Secure Data & Backend Encryption SDK

The MdSecure SDK is a robust Node.js library designed to provide powerful AES-256 GCM encryption and decryption for your backend and API communications. It aims to enhance data privacy, combat web scraping, and fortify your API security posture.

### Why MdSecure SDK?

In today's digital landscape, many web services expose their API data in plain JSON formats, easily viewable via browser developer tools. This vulnerability makes them prone to web scraping, data harvesting, and unauthorized access. MdSecure SDK addresses this by ensuring your data remains encrypted and unintelligible when intercepted, safeguarding your valuable information and providing a competitive edge.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **AES-256 GCM Encryption:** Implements the Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of your data.
*   **Robust Key Derivation:** Securely derives AES keys from your master key using `scryptSync`, a cryptographic key derivation function designed to be computationally intensive and resistant to brute-force attacks.
*   **Structured "msc" Data Format:** Encrypts API responses into a custom "msc" (ModderSecure Crypted) JSON-like format, making intercepted data unintelligible and harder to reverse-engineer.
    *   Each encrypted response includes a unique `request` identifier and an `is_secured: true` flag for clear identification.
*   **Explicit Security Validation:** Instantly rejects requests/data explicitly marked with `is_secured: false` or those with malformed "msc" structures, acting as a "fail-fast" security mechanism against unencrypted or tampered inputs.
*   **Premium PseudoKey Mechanism:** Offers an advanced layer of security and controlled access for premium clients, enabling complex, obfuscated API interactions that are extremely difficult to trace or scrape.
*   **Server-Side Execution:** All core encryption and decryption processes, along with master key management, occur securely on your server, ensuring sensitive keys never reach the client-side.

## üöÄ Installation

Add the MdSecure SDK to your Node.js project using npm:

```bash
npm install mdsecure
